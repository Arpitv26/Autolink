Feature 1: AI Modification Assistant
Conversational AI chat for natural language car modification questions

Acceptance Criteria:
  - Response within 5 seconds
  - Context personalised to user&apos;s saved vehicle
  - Budget tiers provided (budget / mid / premium) where relevant
  - Flags uncertainty rather than guessing
  - Rate-limited to 20 queries/day per user (demo phase)

Feature 2: Visual Modification Planner
Category-zone build planner with mocked catalog and cost tracking

Acceptance Criteria:
  - Add mod cards from mocked parts catalog (static JSON, ~120 parts)
  - Parts organise into category zones with reorder + long-press move
  - Filter by category, brand, price, and search
  - Total cost displayed and updates in real time
  - One active build per primary vehicle persists to Supabase

Tech: react-native-reanimated + gesture-handler + Supabase PostgreSQL
Feature 3: Social Community Feed
Car-community feed for sharing build updates
User Story: &quot;As a car enthusiast, I want to share my build progress and see what others are building so I can get inspired and feel part of a community.&quot;
Acceptance Criteria:
  - Infinite scroll feed (public posts from all users)
  - Upload 1–5 photos per post (from camera roll) with carousel pagination dots
  - Optionally attach one of the author&apos;s garage vehicles, or keep the post general
  - Like/unlike posts (optimistic UI update)
  - Comment with threaded replies
  - Follow/unfollow other users
  - Profile Posts tab filters by All + each garage vehicle
  - Garage tab manages vehicles only (no embedded Vehicle posts placeholder)

Tech: Supabase PostgreSQL + Supabase Storage + expo-image-picker
Feature 4: User Auth + Garage Profile
Social login and vehicle garage that personalises the whole app
User Story: &quot;As a new user, I want to sign in quickly and tell the app what car I drive so every AI answer is relevant to my specific vehicle.&quot;
Acceptance Criteria:
  - Sign in with Google (Apple OAuth is optional for MVP)
  - Lightweight setup gate: display name + first vehicle
  - Profile editing: display name, avatar, bio, pronouns (username locked for now)
  - Garage: 1 free vehicle included; up to 4 additional vehicles unlocked via Pro (year/make/model validated via NHTSA)
  - Pro vehicle paywall can bundle additional premium features later (to be defined)
  - Vehicle context auto-injected into every AI query
  - Profile Posts/Favorites sections show social content; Garage focuses on vehicle CRUD
